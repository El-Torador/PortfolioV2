            <p className="font-normal">
              Computer science is involved in several stages of my life. First of all, between my 6 and 12 years old, I'm a video game geek and my friends hated playing against me every time. Sometimes I pretended to be weak, but in the end, I always won them. Then, between the ages of 12 and 16, I continued playing in parallel with my studies. My father offered me my first computer as a reward after my award for the best student in mathematics at my high school (Manengouba High School in Cameroon) in the 3rd grade.<br /> I've always wondered how video games work, so I decided to start with them. I fall on several sites, including <b>Developpez.com and the site Du Zero</b>. I start learning things and after two months, I create my first <b>RPG game in C</b>, and that's where my passion for computing starts to take off.
            </p>
            <p className="my-4 font-normal">
              After getting my bachelor's degree, my parents decide to enroll me in physics school (a field I also love) for financial troubles where I'm a year old and I learn so much while discovering other computer enthusiasts like me. After this year, I take an entrance contest to an <b>IAI (African Institute of Computer Science)</b> computer engineering school that I obtain and thanks to the sacrifices of my parents and older sisters, I manage to get closer to my dream of being in computer science and practising my passion.<br /> Today, I am an expert in software engineering and I am able to intervene throughout the technical and managerial chain of software construction thanks to my 3 years of training at <b>IAI and ESIEA</b> and my experience accumulated in my different achievements and learning missions.
            </p>
            <p className="font-normal">

              When I don't program, I do a lot of different things like sports (muscle training, basketball, boxing, running...), reading, tutoring (algorithm & programming, mathematics, physics) and even karaoke. I also discover new things. Right now, I'm immersed in economics and astronomy while learning how to play the guitar.
