              In a professional or even personal setting, leadership is essential for good cohesion. A good leader is able to motivate and inspire others to common goals, whileining a clear vision of the direction to follow. As a leader, it is important to know how to make informed decisions, manage conflicts constructively and communicate effectively with your team. <br />

              Recognizing and highlighting the unique talents of each member of the team, in order to make the most of each is part of the ropes of a leader while having and knowing to embody his values and principles that are the pillars for building a strong and performing team.

            <h3 className="my-8 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight dark:text-light">A. Definition of Leadership</h3>
            <p>
              According to John C. Maxwell, leadership can be defined as influence, i.e. the ability to motivate others to follow a vision or common goals. Maxwell often summarizes this idea by saying, "Leadership is influence ‚Äì nothing more, nothing less." This definition emphasizes that the essence of leadership lies in a person's ability to influence the behavior, thoughts and attitudes of others. I would say that it is the ability of a person to positively influence the behaviour of others... because to me being a good leader is to impact others positively while showing an example and being a model for others. <br />A leader must have this natural empathic instinct and know how to use his emotional and rational intelligence while remaining faithful to his vision to guide his team towards success. It also has to question itself most of the time because we are human and we make mistakes and it is these flaws that create a stronger connection with others by giving them the feeling that they can also be wrong and that is normal.

          <div>
            <p>

              It is undeniable that the role of the leader is complex and multifaceted. He must be indulgent and know how to listen to others. The leader will manifest himself in team achievements where he will define a vision and find people who will accompany him in it. He will also manifest himself in times of crisis where he will have to make difficult and unpopular decisions but what drives him to overcome the difficulties is the confidence that others have in him and knowing that it is necessary not to disappoint them, he will always rise up for them. <br /> In the past, I was unable to assume my leadership because of fear of disappointing others, but I learned that leadership is a quality that works and grows with time and that it is a responsibility and a privilege that must be exercised with integrity and ethics.

          <div>
            <p>
              To ensure the well-being of your employees at work and positive results for your company, here are six qualities that will lead you to a good leader: <br />


              <ul className="list-disc">
                <li><b> Interpersonal communication</b>: A leader must be both an excellent communicator and a good interlocutor. Interpersonal communication involves not only the words you use, but also your tone, body language, facial expressions and gestures.</li> <br />

                <li><b>Active listening</b>: Every leader must demonstrate active listening, an indispensable communication skill. This listening ability can help you better understand and proactively address the personal needs, challenges and concerns of each member of your team. Thanks to this, you can get reports and leave a positive impression.</li><br />

                <li><b>Know how to set goals</b>: For a leader, it can be difficult to bring his subordinates together for a common vision. For this, clear and quantifiable targets must be set. Your subordinates will be able to gather and merge around common goals.</li><br />

                <li><b>Conflict resolution</b>: Sometimes conflicts arise between employees or departments, and it is up to management to alleviate tensions and bring staff together. We need to be patient, communicate consistently and take immediate action. If you deal with all conflicts, the working environment will be healthier and more positive for all those involved.</li><br />

                <li><b>Motivate his troops</b>: Stress and heavy workloads can undermine team morale and threaten productivity. It is imperative to listen to your teams and get the best out of them. To effectively motivate your team, do not hesitate to set an example and encourage employees to personal goals. Take the time to learn about everyone‚Äôs ambitions and help them acquire the skills they need to succeed in achieving those goals.</li><br />

                <li><b>Initiative</b>: Leaders have to make many decisions. These range from heavy-handed decisions, such as recruiting a new team member, to the most obvious ones, like choosing to delegate a task or not. The faster and more proactive your decision-making, the more confident your team will be. In order to improve this skill, it is essential to quickly gather all the information you need, to evaluate potential outcomes, and to rely on your experience and instinct.</li>

                <strong>The Good Artists:</strong> I was part of a team of 5 developers including 2 CDI and 3 Alternants (me including). I was able to gain the confidence of my colleagues through the missions carried out and by helping them solve the problems they encountered in their common areas. I also put a lot of humor in our office for a friendly working atmosphere.

                <strong>Azatys:</strong> The autonomy I had at Azatys enabled me to take initiatives on the company's projects by managing a team of 2 freelancers for the launch of the Azati platform. I have been able to trust my employees by letting them express their potential in a healthy and productive working environment.

                <strong>GMC Insurance:</strong> My first experience as a Lead Dev where I had to manage a team of 5 junior developers.

                <strong>Surfer:</strong> One of the most impressive projects in terms of emotion for me and where I made a lot of mistakes. My perfectionist side prompted me to want to do everything myself and not delegate. I quickly recovered to prevent the project from failing, and we ended up in beauty. I have learned from my mistakes and I have never blamed my colleagues, but I have taken responsibility for my actions.

              <li>
                <strong>Torador Community :</strong> This project, based on real-time communication channels, required clear leadership and agile project management. I have ensured that each member of the team understands their role and makes a significant contribution to achieving the goals.

            Le leadership se manifeste √©galement dans la vie personnelle en organisant des activit√©s communautaires ou en prenant des initiatives dans des projets personnels. Je m'efforce de diriger par l'exemple et d'inspirer ceux qui m'entourent au travers des projets collaboratifs comme la planification d'√©v√©nements ou la collaboration √† des projets. J'ai souvent pris des r√¥les de coordination pour assurer le succ√®s de nos efforts communs notamment dans sur Lucid qui est un ORM (Object Relationnal Mapping) fait pour le framework Adonis.

            √ätre un leader efficace comporte des d√©fis. Il faut constamment apprendre √† √©quilibrer les attentes, √† g√©rer les conflits et √† motiver les membres de l'√©quipe. Un bon leader doit aussi √™tre adaptable, capable de s'ajuster aux changements et de guider son √©quipe √† travers les p√©riodes d'incertitude.
